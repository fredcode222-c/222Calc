hello!! thanks for using my first github app. to use this, follow these instructions:
1: open terminal
  1.1: cd to wherever the file is
  1.2: make sure you have 'gcc' installed, if u dont download it
2: type in "gcc 222calc.c -o 222calc . 
3: it should compile, when its done open new terminal window and run it
  3.1: for convenience place it in home root so you can just type '222calc.out' and run it from root
4: enjoy!!
